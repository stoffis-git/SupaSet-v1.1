# Testing the Fixed Issues

## Issue 1: Exercise Toggle/Switch Button Not Working

### How to Test:
1. Go to the **Exercises** tab
2. Make sure you have **multiple exercises active** in the same category (e.g., "Bench Press" and "Overhead Press" for upper_body_push)
3. Go to **Home** and click "New Workout"
4. In the workout preview, click the **"Switch"** button next to any exercise
5. **Expected Result**: The exercise should switch to another exercise from the same category that you have marked as active
6. **Previous Behavior**: Button had no effect even with active alternatives

### Technical Fix:
- Updated `WorkoutPreview` to use `WorkoutContext` instead of `AppContext`
- Modified switch logic to filter by `state.activeExercises` before filtering by category
- **üî• CRITICAL FIX**: Updated category logic to use **Cruise Mode movement patterns** instead of muscle groups
- Enhanced debugging with detailed console logging
- Simplified switch logic to be more robust
- Now only considers exercises you've marked as active in the Exercises tab

### üî• **Major Category Logic Fix**:
**Before**: Used first category (`categories[0]`) ‚Üí `"chest"`, `"back"`, etc.
**After**: Looks for Cruise Mode categories ‚Üí `"upper_body_push"`, `"upper_body_pull"`, `"knee_dominant"`, `"hip_dominant"`

This ensures the switch respects **movement patterns** (what Cruise Mode cares about) rather than **muscle groups** (what other modes might care about).

### Debug Information:
The switch function now logs detailed information to help debug issues:
- Current exercise name and ID
- Target category being searched (**now shows Cruise Mode category**)
- List of active exercises  
- Eligible exercises for switching
- Selected replacement exercise

Check browser console for `=== SWITCH EXERCISE DEBUG ===` messages.

## Issue 2: Completed Workouts Not Appearing in History

### How to Test:
1. Generate a new workout from Home
2. Start the session and complete **ALL sets** of **ALL exercises**
3. Click "Finish Workout"
4. **Expected Result**: The completed workout should immediately appear in the "History" section on the Home page
5. **Previous Behavior**: Workouts weren't saved or weren't marked as completed properly

### Technical Fix:
- Updated `WorkoutPreview` to use `WorkoutContext` instead of `AppContext` for consistent state management
- Fixed `handleFinishWorkout` to explicitly set `completed: true` on the workout before saving
- Ensured HomePage and WorkoutPreview use the same state store

## Issue 3: Clean Preview UI ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### What Changed:
- **Removed** progression notes from workout preview
- **Removed** sets display (weight √ó reps) from preview
- **Kept** only exercise names and switch buttons for a clean, slim UI
- Preview now shows just the essential information like before

### Previous vs Current:
**Before Fix:**
```
Exercise Name                    [Switch]
üí° Last time: 100kg √ó 8 reps √ó 3 sets
--- √ó --- --- √ó --- --- √ó ---
```

**After Fix:**
```
Exercise Name                    [Switch]
```

## Additional Improvements:

### Memory Functionality:
- First workout: Shows "No previous data - enter your preferred weight and reps"
- Subsequent workouts: Shows "üí° Last time: 100kg √ó 8 reps √ó 3 sets" with prefilled values
- Users can modify prefilled values as desired
- **Note**: Progression notes only appear during actual workout, not in preview

### Context Consistency:
- Updated `ExercisesPage` and `WorkoutPage` to use `WorkoutContext`
- All major components now use the same state management system
- Fixed potential state synchronization issues

## Test Scenarios:

### Scenario A: First Time User
1. Select some exercises in Exercises tab
2. Generate workout ‚Üí should show clean preview with exercise names only
3. Start workout ‚Üí should show empty fields with "No previous data" message
4. Complete workout ‚Üí should appear in history

### Scenario B: Returning User  
1. Generate workout ‚Üí should show clean preview (no prefilled data visible)
2. Switch exercises ‚Üí should only show alternatives from active exercises **using correct Cruise Mode categories**
3. Start workout ‚Üí should show prefilled values with "Last time" message
4. Complete workout ‚Üí should appear in history immediately

### Scenario C: Exercise Management
1. Deactivate an exercise in Exercises tab
2. Generate workout ‚Üí that exercise should not appear
3. Switch button ‚Üí should only offer alternatives from remaining active exercises

### Scenario D: Upper Body Push/Pull Testing ‚≠ê **MOST IMPORTANT**
**Test with these exercise pairs (now using correct categories):**
- Bench Press ‚Üî Overhead Press (both `upper_body_push`)
- Pull-up ‚Üî Barbell Row (both `upper_body_pull`)
- Squat ‚Üî Front Squat (both `knee_dominant`)  
- Deadlift ‚Üî Romanian Deadlift (both `hip_dominant`)

Make sure **both exercises in each pair are active** in the Exercises tab before testing the switch functionality.

**Expected Debug Output (Fixed):**
```
=== SWITCH EXERCISE DEBUG ===
Current Exercise: Bench Press ID: 1
Target Category (Cruise Mode): upper_body_push  ‚Üê ‚úÖ CORRECT!
Switchable Exercises: [Overhead Press]          ‚Üê ‚úÖ SHOULD WORK!
```

**Previous Debug Output (Broken):**
```
Target Category: chest                          ‚Üê ‚ùå WRONG!
No switchable exercises found for category: chest ‚Üê ‚ùå FAILED!
```
